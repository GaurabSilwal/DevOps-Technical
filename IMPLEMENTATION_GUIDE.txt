MICROSERVICES IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
===================================

This document explains how the microservices architecture is implemented across Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD.

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
--------------------
The application consists of 4 components:
1. api-service (Node.js REST API)
2. worker-service (Python background jobs)
3. frontend-service (React + Nginx)
4. Database layer (PostgreSQL + Redis)

PART 1: DOCKER IMPLEMENTATION
=============================

Production-Grade Dockerfiles:

1. API Service (api-service/Dockerfile):
   - Multi-stage build with Node.js 18 Alpine
   - Non-root user (nodejs:1001) for security
   - Health checks with HTTP endpoint
   - Security updates and dumb-init for proper signal handling
   - Production environment variables

2. Worker Service (worker-service/Dockerfile):
   - Python 3.11 slim base image
   - Non-root user (worker) for security
   - Health check using Redis ping
   - Celery worker process

3. Frontend Service (frontend-service/Dockerfile):
   - Multi-stage build: Node.js build + Nginx serve
   - Optimized Nginx configuration with compression
   - Security headers and caching policies
   - Non-root user for Nginx process

Docker Compose (docker-compose.yml):
- PostgreSQL with persistent volume and health checks
- Redis with health checks
- Service dependencies and restart policies
- Environment variable configuration
- Port mappings for local development

Git Configuration (.gitignore):
- Excludes node_modules/ directories
- Ignores log files and debug outputs
- Excludes environment files (.env)
- Ignores OS-specific files (.DS_Store)
- Prevents tracking of build artifacts

PART 2: KUBERNETES IMPLEMENTATION
=================================

Namespace Organization:
- All services deployed in 'microservices' namespace

Database Layer:
1. PostgreSQL (k8s/postgres.yaml):
   - PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence (5Gi)
   - ConfigMap for initialization SQL
   - Health checks with pg_isready
   - Service for internal communication

2. Redis (k8s/redis.yaml):
   - Deployment with health checks
   - Service for queue communication

Application Services:
1. API Service (k8s/api-service.yaml):
   - 3 replicas with rolling update strategy
   - HorizontalPodAutoscaler (3-10 replicas, 70% CPU/80% memory)
   - PodDisruptionBudget (minimum 2 available)
   - Security context (non-root, read-only filesystem)
   - Resource limits and requests
   - Liveness/readiness probes

2. Worker Service (k8s/worker-service.yaml):
   - 2 replicas for background job processing
   - Resource limits for memory and CPU
   - Environment variables for DB and Redis connection

3. Frontend Service (k8s/frontend-service.yaml):
   - 2 replicas with NodePort service (30080)
   - Health checks on Nginx endpoint
   - Resource optimization for static content

Networking:
- Ingress (k8s/ingress.yaml) for external access
- Services for internal communication
- Path-based routing (/api for backend, / for frontend)

PART 3: CI/CD IMPLEMENTATION
============================

GitHub Actions Pipeline (.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml):

Test Stage:
- Node.js 18 setup for frontend and API
- Python 3.11 setup for worker service
- Dependency installation with npm install
- Unit tests with coverage reporting
- Database mocking for API tests

Build Stage:
- Multi-service Docker builds (api, worker, frontend)
- Push to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
- Image tagging with commit SHA and branch
- Docker layer caching for optimization

Deploy Stage:
- Manifest updates with new image tags
- Kubernetes deployment preparation
- Image references updated to registry URLs

Rollback Mechanism (.github/workflows/rollback.yml):
- Manual workflow dispatch trigger
- Service selection (individual or all services)
- Revision-based rollback using kubectl
- Rollout status verification

SCALABILITY FEATURES
====================

1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler:
   - API service scales 3-10 replicas based on CPU/memory
   - Automatic scaling policies with stabilization windows

2. Resource Management:
   - CPU/memory requests and limits for all services
   - Efficient resource allocation

3. Load Distribution:
   - Multiple replicas for each service
   - Service-based load balancing

FAULT TOLERANCE FEATURES
========================

1. Health Checks:
   - Liveness probes for container restart
   - Readiness probes for traffic routing
   - Database connection validation

2. Pod Disruption Budget:
   - Minimum 2 API service pods always available
   - Graceful handling of node maintenance

3. Rolling Updates:
   - Zero-downtime deployments
   - Gradual replica replacement

4. Persistent Storage:
   - Database data survives pod restarts
   - PVC ensures data persistence

OBSERVABILITY FEATURES
======================

1. Logging:
   - Structured logging in all services
   - Request/response logging in API service

2. Monitoring Ready:
   - Prometheus annotations on API service
   - Health check endpoints for monitoring

3. Resource Monitoring:
   - Resource usage tracking via Kubernetes metrics
   - HPA metrics for scaling decisions

SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
=======================

1. Container Security:
   - Non-root users in all containers
   - Read-only root filesystems where possible
   - Security capability dropping
   - Regular base image updates

2. Network Security:
   - Internal service communication only
   - Ingress-controlled external access
   - Security headers in Nginx

3. Secret Management:
   - Environment variables for configuration
   - Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data

DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW
==================

Local Development:
1. Run `make up` for Docker Compose deployment
2. Access application at http://localhost

Kubernetes Deployment:
1. Run `./scripts/deploy-all.sh` for full deployment
2. Access via NodePort at http://localhost:30080

CI/CD Process:
1. Code push triggers automated testing
2. Successful tests trigger Docker builds
3. Images pushed to GitHub Container Registry
4. Manifests updated with new image tags
5. Manual deployment to Kubernetes cluster

Rollback Process:
1. Trigger rollback workflow manually
2. Select service and revision
3. Automatic rollback execution
4. Verification of rollback success

This implementation provides a production-ready microservices platform with proper containerization, orchestration, and automation.
